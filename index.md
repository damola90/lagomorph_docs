# Overview
The Lagomorph AI 3D generator tool is a simple user-friendly tool for generating and manipulating 3D models for use in game development.

## Core Use Cases

### Artists
For game artists, the tool allows you offload a lot of the tedious parts of generating 3D models for games so you can focus on what matters most, **creativity**. Use the tool to generate 3D models from an image or text description and optimize the models for game development. You can then add your creative adjustments to the models of your choosing within your preferred 3D model editor  

### Game developers
For game developers, the tool allows you to get quick access to 3D models to use in your games, giving you more time to focus on other aspects of the game development pipeline. This allows you to turbo-boost your overall game development process, especially prototyping and content generation
